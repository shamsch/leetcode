# LEETCODE PROBLEM SOLVING 

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). I occasionally solve problems to keep my coding skills sharp, but mostly I do it for fun. 

**You are free to use my solutions as a reference, but please do not copy and paste them. I would recommend you to try to solve the problems yourself first.**

Problems are solved in **Python**, but maybe there will be some **Javascript** solutions too.
